# Classifying Voice Disorders with Support Vector Machine

## Summary
- Graduation Project 2 modeled after this research https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8316845
- The motivation of this project was to learn more about voice analysis by trying to reproduce the result from previous model research.
- Using Python, PRAAT, and Parselmouth, I was able to extract features from the voice datasets from Saarbruecken Voice Database and run support vector machine on it to identify voice disorders.
